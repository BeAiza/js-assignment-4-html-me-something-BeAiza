            <h2>What Is a Barista?</h2>
            <p>A barista is someone who makes and servers espresso based coffee. This person usually has a strong interest in coffee as well as the "vibes" in and around it. The majority think that when you make coffee it's just pressing a button and boom a latte is made. While this may work for Starbucks, there was a lot of meticulous work to get there and that many coffee shops or baristas still do today.</p>

               <h2>Dialing In Espresso!</h2>
               <p>The espresso machine has a calibration proccess of its own but, like the machine, the barista does as well. This is controling the dosage, time, and yield of the espresso they call "dialing in". The ideal messurment is 18g of ground espresso bean in the portafilter, at 26 seconds(time) the portafilter pours out 40g of liquid espresso(yield). These parameters are what pull a "perfect" shot of espresso!</p><!-- typing the dial in proccess -->

               <h3>Extraction and How to Measure It</h3>
               <p>Extraction is the process of hot water pulling through the portafilter. How long our shot is pulled determines the level of extraction the espresso undergoes, therefore, the longer a shot is pulled, the more extracted it will be. If the time is shortened, the less extracted your shot will be. All of our parameters play into extraction.</p>

               <h3>Tasting your espresso!</h3>
               <p>The most effective way to taste your espresso is by feeling where the tastes hit your tongue. SOUR tasting espresso indicates that your shot is UNDER extracted, BITTER tasting espresso indicates that your shot is OVER extracted. The goal is a well balanced espresso shot, this means it is equally bitter/sour.</p>

               <h3>Adjusting the Grind Size</h3>
               <p>The espresso grinder is used to grind the roasted coffee beans to the proper size for accurate extraction. The important thing to note some grinders are sensitive and should not be adjusted dramatically. There are two parameters located on the grinder fine and course. The finer the grind the slower water passes through the espresso. The courser the grind the faster water passes through the espresso. </p>

               <h2>Espresso Based Drinks</h2>
               <figure><img src="https://as1.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/00/79/06/32/1000_F_79063254_ZgmBdEjHPEzlApGhQXN2RE5ixHYyV52u.jpg"></figure>
               <p>The majority of people think that there is only one types of espresso drink which is a latte, but there are many diffrent drinks baristas have created to enjoy espresso. The list below is just a few diffrent ones.</p>
               <p>Macchiato: Single shot with 1.5 oz foamed milk steamed at 140℉</p>
               <p>Cortado: Double shot with  2 oz steamed milk at 140℉</p>
               <p>Cappuccino: Single shot with texturized milk steamed at 140℉</p>
               <p>Flat white: Single shot with 8 oz of steamed milk to 160℉</p>
               <p>There are at least 12 more espresso drinks on top of this short list that gives the consumer and barista more variety to enjoy drinking and making.  </p>

               <h2>Into the Barista Rabbit Hole</h2>
               <figure><img src="https://perfectdailygrind.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/baristas4-e1505407152257.jpg"></figure>
               <p>This is just a soft opening to what a barista can do and what is possible. The further you get you start to see the art on top of the lattes, what professional espresso tasters are("cuppers"), and the thing baristas do with regular ground coffee (french pressing, pourovers etc.). I've given you as much barista knowledge I have and implore you to jump in that rabbit hole and see how far it goes!</p>
